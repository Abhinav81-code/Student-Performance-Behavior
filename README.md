# 🎓 Student Grading Analysis
📘 Overview
This project explores student academic data to evaluate performance trends and identify key factors influencing grades. It combines data preprocessing, visualization, and Power BI dashboarding to uncover meaningful educational insights.

🧾 Project Files
student_grading_data.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling

student grading project.pbix – Power BI dashboard for interactive visual analysis

🔍 Key Objectives
Analyze student demographic and academic data

Explore factors affecting final grades (e.g., attendance, parental education, study time)

Use visualizations to communicate trends and insights

Build a basic predictive model (if applicable) for final grade estimation

📊 Dataset Features (assumed based on common grading datasets)
gender, age, study_time, failures, absences

parental_education, internet, extra_classes, grade_math, grade_reading, grade_writing

final_grade – Main target variable for performance evaluation

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)

Power BI: For creating an interactive dashboard to present student performance metrics

(Optional): Scikit-learn for modeling student performance

📈 Outcomes
Identified top factors influencing student grades

Built insightful charts and dashboards to monitor academic trends

Developed a student performance grading report with interactive filtering by class, gender, and subject
